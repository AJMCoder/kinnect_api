Bug Fixing:

- When running tests for the Post list, i discovered an error "ERROR: test_can_list_posts (posts.tests.PostListViewTests.test_can_list_posts)". Reading through the error message allowed me to rectify the issue and traceback to the Post.views file where the error persists because the request context was not being passed to the serializer in the PostListView.
